# semEval2024: Semantic Textual Relatedness - Pinealai Code 
### Description Task 1 English
A shared task on automatically detecting the degree of semantic relatedness between pairs of sentences. New textual datasets will be provided for Afrikaans, Algerian Arabic, Amharic, English, Hausa, Hindi, Indonesian, Kinyarwanda, Marathi, Moroccan Arabic, Modern Standard Arabic, Punjabi, Spanish, and Telugu. 

### Brief Methodology
In this study, our objective is to predict semantic textual relatedness between two texts. We made
two key assumptions:
- We refrained from preprocessing the corpus to preserve sentence structure, essential for information retrieval and semantic identification (Hirst, 1987);
- We intentionally excluded Large Language Models (LLMs) from experiments, anticipating challenges in interpreting specific features contributing to semantic identification due to their contextual abilities and complexity.
